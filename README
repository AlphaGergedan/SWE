This branch of SWE is significantly different from the normal one
You need ULFM, teaMPI, and the NetCDF library to compile it. If you intend to work with this code, you probably know what these are and where to find them.
Use CMake to build SWE. Refer to the ULFM and teaMPI section in the CMakeLists.txt file to set the correct paths.

If you want to test the recovery, modify line 733 in src/main.cpp

Once it's built, use it like this:

TEAMS=[num of teams] SPARES=[num of warm spares] swe -t [sim duration in simulated seconds] -c [real seconds between heartbeats] -x [cells in x direction] -y [cells in y direction] -d [multiply blocks per rank by this number, default 1] -o [output path] -b [checkpoint path] -r [restart path (for manually loading checkpoints)]
